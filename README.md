All the stuff I keep having to reimplement, or that I might need again in the
future. A pocketknife is a multitasker - this repo is my go-to for all the
little tasks that I can reuse in other projects.

## Not Invented Here

There's stuff here that's already readily available. Many of these libraries
are as much a learning exercise as they are a useful tool. That means the
quality may not be quite production-grade yet, or there may be issues that
stem from learning by doing. You've been warned :)
